## Definitions

### Monoid

> Monoid is an operation that obey 2 laws: associative law and identity law

#### Examples

##### Int Addition

Addition is associative because `a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c`
Addition has identity `0` because `a + 0 = a`

##### Boolean And

*And* is associative because `a && (b && c) = (a && b) && c`
*And* has identity `true` because `a && true = a`

##### Set Union

Union is associative because `a union (b union c) = (a union b) union c`
Union has identity empty set because `a union Set.empty = a`

### Semigroup

> Semigroup is an operation that obey 1 law: associative law

#### Examples

##### Set Intersect

Intersect is associative because `a intersect (b intersect c) = (a intersect b) intersect c`

But it doesn't have identity, e.g. suppose identity for this monoid is empty set, then the following expression must be true `a intersect Set.Empty = a`, but it can't be true, because intersection with empty set is empty set

## Monoid and Semigroup in Cats

[Semigroup](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/semigroup.html)

#### Useful imports

```scala
// Cats monoid type class
import cats.Monoid
// Cats semigroup type class
import cats.Semigroup
// combine operator |+|
import cats.syntax.semigroup._
// implicits
import cats.instances.double._  
import cats.instances.int._  
import cats.instances.optios._  
// etc.
```

#### Examples

##### Implementing monoid for custom case classes

```scala

// Cats monoid type class
import cats.Monoid
// combine operator |+|
import cats.syntax.semigroup._
// monoid implicits for double
import cats.instances.double._  


case class Order(totalCost: Double, quantity: Double)

object Order {  
  
  implicit val orderMonoid: Monoid[Order] = new Monoid[Order] {  
    override def empty: Order = Order(Monoid[Double].empty, Monoid[Double].empty)  
  
    override def combine(x: Order, y: Order): Order = {  
      Order(x.totalCost |+| y.totalCost, x.quantity |+| y.quantity)  
    }  
  }  
}

```
