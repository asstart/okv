## Goals of DW/BI

*   Make information easily accesible
*   Present information in a timely way
*   Protect the information asset
*   Be a authoritative and trustworthy foundation for decision making process

## Dimension modelling

### Fact tables

*   As it's the larges set of data, must not be replicated many times. (Replication in this context refers to not storing this in multiple systems or multiple time in the same system and talks nothing about replication in context of data durability)
*   Each row in a fact table corresponds to a measurement event
*   Typically *fact* is a numeric. Facts can be:
    *   Additive e.g sales amount, no matter how you group your data by time period or by some category, values of this facts can be added to get total amount
    *   Semi-additive - facts that can summed only by certain dimensions e.g. account balances. You can't sum them over time, it just make no sence
    *   Non-additive - fact that can't be summed in any cases e.g. unit price

### Dimension tables

> The data wareshouse built with dimension model in mind is only as good as the dimension attributes.

*   Real words instead cryptic abbrevations for attributes name
*   Minimize use of code attributes values and replcae them with(or put alongside) verbose text attributes
*   If codes contain some kind of knowledge itself(e.g. digit on a certain position may mean something and can be used for filtering) - it's better to extract this knowledge to a separate attribute. It will make easier to learn what type of dimenshions table contains. It will reduce complexity of queries, so users won't need anymore write queries with regexps to filter out certain rows.

### Opertaional source

Some sort of production system that uses to store transactions related to a company business in a way that most suited to support performance and availability requirements. It means that this systems most likely aren't purposed to execute heavy aggregations in a differenet dimensions that can be really important for analytics.

Most likely it's out of control of DW team.

### ETL

Shortly it's everything in between the operational source and presentation area. This systems responsible for capturing data from sources, transform to a format required by presentation layer and store.

*   Extract - is a first step, it means capturing data or portion of data from the source system and copying it for further manipulations
*   Transform - is a complex process which incapsulate a lot of operations that must be execute on data. On this step data can be correccted, cleaned, deduplicated, transformed to a certain standard format, combined with data from other sources
*   Load - final step in which data must be structured and loaded to a presentation area.

Typically handling dimension tables is more complex process that includes many different transformations like splitting or combining columns, lookup descriptions for certain attributes,
denormalize normalized tables. In contrast hadnling fact tables might be much simplier process but much more resource demand bucause fact tables tupically meky up up 90% of whole DW data volume.

### Presentation area

Here the data is organized and stored. It's the only data that business sees and touches via access tools or BI tools. Data must be stored in a dimensional schemas like star schema. It's highly recommended that stored data has the highest available granularity. From this it will be available to get any aggregates that business needs.

### BI App

There're many different types of app from a simple ad hoc queury executore up to complex data mining tools.

> Which key features do data warehouse have?

1.  Historical Data: A data warehouse stores historical data that can be used for trend analysis and decision making.
2.  Integrating Data from Multiple Sources: A data warehouse integrates data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the data.
3.  Relational Database Structure: A data warehouse typically uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store the data. This allows for fast, efficient querying and analysis.
4.  Dimension-Based Data Model: A data warehouse uses a dimension-based data model to organize the data. This allows for intuitive and easy-to-use analysis.
5.  Optimized for Query Performance: A data warehouse is optimized for query performance, allowing for fast and efficient analysis.
6.  Scalability: A data warehouse is designed to be scalable, allowing for the storage of large amounts of data and the support of a large number of users.
7.  Data Quality: a data warehouse is designed to ensure high data quality, allowing for accurate and trustworthy analysis.
8.  Security: A data warehouse implements security measures to ensure that sensitive data is protected.
9.  Extensibility: A data warehouse is designed to be extensible, allowing for new data sources and types of analysis to be added over time.

> What is dimension modelling?

Dimension modeling is a technique for designing a data warehouse. It involves organizing data into dimensions and facts, which are used to support business intelligence and analysis.

In dimensional modeling, a dimension is a structure that categorizes data and provides context for the data in a fact table. For example, a time dimension might include information about date and time, such as the year, quarter, month, day, and hour.

A fact table, on the other hand, contains the data that is being analyzed. It includes columns for each dimension, as well as columns for the measures being analyzed, such as sales, profit, or quantity.

The goal of dimensional modeling is to create a data model that is easy to understand and use, and that supports fast and efficient querying and analysis. This is achieved by organizing the data in a way that is intuitive and that matches the way business users think about and analyze their data.

> Why is it important to understand business requirements?

It is important to understand business requirements in order to build a successful data warehouse for the following reasons:

1.  Aligning the Data Warehouse with Business Needs: Understanding the business requirements allows the data warehouse to be designed and built in a way that meets the needs of the business. This leads to a higher level of user adoption and satisfaction.
2.  Improving Data Quality: By understanding the business requirements, the data warehouse can be designed to capture the right data, at the right level of detail, and with the right level of quality. This leads to better data quality and more accurate analysis.
3.  Prioritizing Features and Functionality: By understanding the business requirements, the data warehouse team can prioritize the features and functionality that are most important to the business. This ensures that the data warehouse is delivering the most value to the business.
4.  Avoiding Unnecessary Work: Understanding the business requirements allows the data warehouse team to avoid unnecessary work. For example, if a business requirement is to support analysis at the regional level, then it is not necessary to capture data at a more granular level, such as the city level.
