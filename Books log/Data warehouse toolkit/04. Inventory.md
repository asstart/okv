## Enterprise Bus Architecture

The enterprise data warehouse bus architecture provides a framework for designing and implementing a comprehensive DW/BI environment. The bus is a standard interface specification that allows separate dimensional models to plug in and coexist. The architecture is technology-independent and allows different development teams to work fairly independently while adhering to the overall design. The bus architecture is based on conformed dimensions and facts, which have a uniform interpretation across the enterprise, allowing separate systems to be integrated into a single whole.

The enterprise data warehouse bus matrix is a tool used to document and communicate the organization's data architecture. It consists of rows representing business processes and columns representing common dimensions across the enterprise. The matrix cells are marked to indicate the relationships between the dimensions and business processes. The matrix helps to minimize implementation risk by starting with a single business process, reducing ETL development risk, and allowing for easy visualization of the relationships between dimensions and processes. The number of rows and columns in the matrix varies depending on the organization, with a range of 25 to 50 for both. The bus matrix is a fundamental concept introduced by Kimball in the 1990s and has since been renamed by others as the conformance or event matrix.

## Conformed Dimensions

Conformed dimensions enable the combination of performance measurements from different business processes in a single report through a process called drilling across. There are several types of conformed dimensions, including identical conformed dimensions, shrunken rollup conformed dimensions with attribute subsets, and shrunken conformed dimensions with row subsets.

### Identical Conformed Dimensions

Identical conformed dimensions are the most basic type of conformed dimensions and refer to dimensions that have the same meaning with every possible fact table that they are joined to. They have consistent dimension keys, attribute column names, attribute definitions, and attribute values which result in consistent report labels and groupings. The dimension tables should have the same number of rows, same key values, same attribute labels, same attribute data definitions, and same attribute values. Most conformed dimensions are defined naturally at the most granular level possible, such as an individual product or day. The attribute column names should be uniquely labeled across dimensions.

### Shrunken Rollup Conformed Dimensions With Attribute Subsets

Shrunken rollup dimensions are used when a fact table captures metrics at a higher level of granularity than the base dimension. Common attributes between the two tables should be labeled, defined, and identically valued.

### Shrunken Conformed Dimension with Row Subset

Another case of conformed dimension subsetting occurs when two dimensions are at the same level of detail, but one represents only a subset of rows. For example, a corporate product dimension contains rows for the full portfolio of products across multiple disparate lines of business. Analysts in the separate businesses may want to view only their subset of the corporate dimension, restricted to the product rows for their business
